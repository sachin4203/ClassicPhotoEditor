Classic Photo Editor
==============

This app uses the camera and displays the
viewfinder for taking a picture. The taken photo is then processed with the
predefined filters. The filter properties can be manipulated and the changes can
be seen in the preview image immediately. The processed image can be saved in
JPEG format into the camera roll album. You can also select an existing photo
and apply an effect to it.
